# JumpHare
An SDL2 OpenGL game written in C, also working on Web and Android.
Based on [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some) framework.

## Art
Pixelart was made with my [Pixelc](https://github.com/renehorstmann/pixelc) App.
Tile maps are designed with [Tilec](https://github.com/renehorstmann/tilec).
Both Apps are also based on [some](https://github.com/renehorstmann/some) framework.

    - Color_s replacement or typedef

## Compiling on Windows
Compiling with Mingw (msys2).
Currently not working with cmake, but with the following gcc call.
I had to put all source files into one dir (from src/e/*, r/*, p/*, u/* into src/*) to get the linker happy.
```
gcc -o some src/* -Iinclude $(sdl2-config --cflags --libs) -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lglew32 -lopengl32 -lglu32 -DUSING_GLEW
```
